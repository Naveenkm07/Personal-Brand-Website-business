## Project overview

Mono Brand System is a compact identity kit centered on typography, spacing, and consistency.

## Problem statement

Creative studios often ship fast without a clear system, leading to mismatched typography, inconsistent spacing, and assets that don’t translate across mediums.

## Solution

I built a minimal but flexible system:

- Modular type scale
- Neutral palette + one accent
- Clear rules for hierarchy and spacing

## Tools & tech used

- Figma (system planning and layout)
- Next.js (for a component-first site structure)
- Tailwind CSS (for consistent spacing + tokens)

## Final result

The result is a brand foundation that stays quiet while making the work feel intentional and coherent.
