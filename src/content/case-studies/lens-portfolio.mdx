## Project overview

Lens Portfolio is a clean, image-led layout built for browsing quickly without losing context.

## Problem statement

Many photo portfolios overload the viewer with UI. Images become secondary to controls, filters, and unnecessary effects.

## Solution

I designed a simple flow:

1. **Browse** via a masonry grid that respects image variety
2. **Open** a focused preview (modal or detail page)
3. **Read** context only when needed

## Tools & tech used

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (for subtle transitions)

## Final result

The final experience is minimal, fast, and content-first: images stay primary, with just enough structure to guide the viewer.
