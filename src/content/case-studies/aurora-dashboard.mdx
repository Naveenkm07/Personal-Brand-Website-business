## Project overview

Aurora Dashboard is a portfolio-ready case study that demonstrates a clean analytics UI with subtle motion.

## Problem statement

Many analytics dashboards suffer from visual noise. Key signals get buried under competing cards, inconsistent spacing, and unclear hierarchy.

## Solution

I designed a layout system that emphasizes readability and rhythm:

- Clear type scale and consistent spacing
- Calm surfaces with a single accent color
- Small motion cues for orientation (not decoration)

## Tools & tech used

- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- MDX (for documenting patterns)

## Final result

The final concept feels premium and focused: fast scanning, fewer distractions, and motion that supports comprehension.
